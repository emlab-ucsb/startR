# Introduction

In this awesome manuscript, we show that there is a correlation between sepal length and sepal width for three species of *Iris spp.*. The three species are:

```{r}

```

# Methods

We fit a linear model with sepal width as a function of sepal length:

$$
SW = mSL + b
$$

# Results

Figure \@ref(plot) shows that larger petals are lighter.

```{r plot, fig.cap = "Relationship between sepal width (gr) and sepal length (cm) for three *Iris spp*.}
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtheme_plot() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length (cm)",
       y = "Sepal Width (gr)") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

# So what?

Yeah, that's about it.
